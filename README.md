# Tv-and-remote-program

Hello, My name is Joebeck Andrew F. Gusi from BSCPE 1-5.

The TV Controller Application is a basic GUI program written in Tkinter that allows users to control a virtual TV. 
Users can use this app to turn on/off the TV, change the channel from 1 to 120, and modify the volume level from 1 to 7.
Contributions are encouraged! Please raise an issue or send a pull request if you find any bugs or want to add new functionality.

Thank you and Enjoy using my program.
